# play-domain

##### Summary
Play Domain is an application that uses Sptofy to allow a user to generate a playlist of thirty songs based on multiple artists of their
choice. Once they have signed up, the user will log in to their very own Spotify account then input their artists. The playlist will be
created and added to their library, allowing them to listen in browser or on the official Spotify app.

Instructions for navigating the Play Domain can be found on the Play Domain [homepage](https://playdomain.herokuapp.com/).
